After graduating from a professional development course at Code Clan I developed a passion for building software. I really enjoy the problem solving nature of programming, locating issues in code and discovering a solution. 

I have really enjoyed expanding my skill set over the past few years, from working as a consultant on different technologies, and currently working as a full stack developer in application support on a single project. 

I really enjoy the creativity development affords, the very idea that I have the skill set to create a game seemed too exciting not to take advantage of! So I have decided to create this dev diary to document my progress, stumbling blocks and learning experiences.
